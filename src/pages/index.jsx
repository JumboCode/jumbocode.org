        The sun was shining on the sea,
        <br />
        Shining with all his might:
        <br />
        He did his very best to make
        <br />
        The billows smooth and bright —
        <br />
        And this was odd, because it was
        <br />
        The middle of the night.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        The moon was shining sulkily,
        <br />
        Because she thought the sun
        <br />
        Had got no business to be there
        <br />
        After the day was done —
        <br />
        “It’s very rude of him,” she said,
        <br />
        “To come and spoil the fun.”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        The sea was wet as wet could be,
        <br />
        The sands were dry as dry.
        <br />
        You could not see a cloud, because
        <br />
        No cloud was in the sky:
        <br />
        No birds were flying overhead —
        <br />
        There were no birds to fly.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        The Walrus and the Carpenter
        <br />
        Were walking close at hand;
        <br />
        They wept like anything to see
        <br />
        Such quantities of sand:
        <br />
        “If this were only cleared away,”
        <br />
        They said, “it would be grand!”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “If seven maids with seven mops
        <br />
        Swept it for half a year,
        <br />
        Do you suppose,” the Walrus said,
        <br />
        “That they could get it clear?”
        <br />
        “I doubt it,” said the Carpenter,
        <br />
        And shed a bitter tear.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “O Oysters, come and walk with us!”
        <br />
        The Walrus did beseech.
        <br />
        “A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
        <br />
        Along the briny beach:
        <br />
        We cannot do with more than four,
        <br />
        To give a hand to each.”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        The eldest Oyster looked at him,
        <br />
        But never a word he said:
        <br />
        The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
        <br />
        And shook his heavy head —
        <br />
        Meaning to say he did not choose
        <br />
        To leave the oyster-bed.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        But four young Oysters hurried up,
        <br />
        All eager for the treat:
        <br />
        Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
        <br />
        Their shoes were clean and neat —
        <br />
        And this was odd, because, you know,
        <br />
        They hadn’t any feet.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        Four other Oysters followed them,
        <br />
        And yet another four;
        <br />
        And thick and fast they came at last,
        <br />
        And more, and more, and more —
        <br />
        All hopping through the frothy waves,
        <br />
        And scrambling to the shore.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        The Walrus and the Carpenter
        <br />
        Walked on a mile or so,
        <br />
        And then they rested on a rock
        <br />
        Conveniently low:
        <br />
        And all the little Oysters stood
        <br />
        And waited in a row.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “The time has come,” the Walrus said,
        <br />
        “To talk of many things:
        <br />
        Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —
        <br />
        Of cabbages — and kings —
        <br />
        And why the sea is boiling hot —
        <br />
        And whether pigs have wings.”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “But wait a bit,” the Oysters cried,
        <br />
        “Before we have our chat;
        <br />
        For some of us are out of breath,
        <br />
        And all of us are fat!”
        <br />
        “No hurry!” said the Carpenter.
        <br />
        They thanked him much for that.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “A loaf of bread,” the Walrus said,
        <br />
        “Is what we chiefly need:
        <br />
        Pepper and vinegar besides
        <br />
        Are very good indeed —
        <br />
        Now if you’re ready, Oysters dear,
        <br />
        We can begin to feed.”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “But not on us!” the Oysters cried,
        <br />
        Turning a little blue.
        <br />
        “After such kindness, that would be
        <br />
        A dismal thing to do!”
        <br />
        “The night is fine,” the Walrus said.
        <br />
        Do you admire the view?
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “It was so kind of you to come!
        <br />
        And you are very nice!”
        <br />
        The Carpenter said nothing but
        <br />
        “Cut us another slice:
        <br />
        I wish you were not quite so deaf —
        <br />
        I’ve had to ask you twice!”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “It seems a shame,” the Walrus said,
        <br />
        “To play them such a trick,
        <br />
        After we’ve brought them out so far,
        <br />
        And made them trot so quick!”
        <br />
        The Carpenter said nothing but
        <br />
        “The butter’s spread too thick!”
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “I weep for you,” the Walrus said:
        <br />
        “I deeply sympathize.”
        <br />
        With sobs and tears he sorted out
        <br />
        Those of the largest size,
        <br />
        Holding his pocket-handkerchief
        <br />
        Before his streaming eyes.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginTop: '0.5em' }}>
        “O Oysters,” said the Carpenter,
        <br />
        “You’ve had a pleasant run!
        <br />
        Shall we be trotting home again?”
        <br />
        But answer came there none —
        <br />
        And this was scarcely odd, because
        <br />
        They’d eaten every one.
